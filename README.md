This is a project that has as an aim to automate the outputs of statistical programs like R, Jasp, Jamovi, PSPP (and thus SPSS) into useful reports. 

I am searching for collaborators that know to program in python / c / c++ (or u can suggest other language - NO JAVA) languages in order to code this project more properly. Please contact me if you are interest estatisticseu@gmail.com.

### For collaborators
If you know how to manipulate - in  a computer program language - large tables with numbers and transpose them, remove or add columns then you may contact me. To test your self, You may try to make tables in Sheet 1 of output_ind_ttest.csv to looks like in Sheet 2 of same file.
